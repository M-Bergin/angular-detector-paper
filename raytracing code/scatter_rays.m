% Gateway frunction for the C function that scatters rays in 2D. Scatters the
% provided rays off the provided surface returning the final direction positions
% and number of scattering events of the rays. Arrays need to be provided in the
% correct orientation for conversion to C arrays.
%
% INPUTS:
%  surface - struct, {vertices, normals}. Details the 1D surface that the rays
%            are to be scattered off. Both are arrays of two element column
%            vectors, the number of nurmals must be one less than the number of
%            vertices.
%  rays    - struct, {initial_positions, initial_direction}. Details the rays
%            that are to be scattered off the 1D surface. The positions are
%            specified by an array of n 2 element column vectors and the
%            direction is specified by a single 2 element column vector.
%  scattering - struct, {type_of_scattering, scattering_parameters}. Defines the
%               model for the scattering process (specular, diffuse, ...) along
%               with any parameters needed for that scatteirng model. The type
%               of scattering is provided as a string and the parameters as an
%               array.
%
% OUPUTS:
%  final_dir    - array of 2 element column vectors of the final directions of
%                 the arrays after they now longer intersect with the surface.
%  final_pos    - array do 2 element column vectors of the final positions of
%                 the arrays after they no longer intersect with the surface.
%  num_scatters - the number of scattering events that each ray undergoes.
